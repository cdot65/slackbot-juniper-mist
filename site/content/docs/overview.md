Example Slack bot for interfacing with your Juniper Mist environment

The repository hopes to act as a guide for building bots with Slack Bolt SDK. In our example, we will be building a Python-based Slack bot that will serve as an interface to Juniper Mist.

This project is structured to be more of an educational guide rather than a production-ready piece of software.

## ‚ùì How to use this guide

The navigation menu on the left hand of this site will be the best method of navigating between the documents.

### Slack bot

This is the meat and potatoes of our documentation, even for those just looking for examples of Mist.

We will cover how the bot is built, how it interacts with the user's input, and how it handles interactions with the Mist REST API.

The all-important code deep dive will be taking place here, and we will discuss the various tools that are provided in the project files to make our lives easier.

### Mist

This can be considered optional if you're only here for the Python, but it's really cool too.
