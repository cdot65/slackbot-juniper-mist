# Slackbot for Juniper Mist

![image](site/content/assets/images/header600.png)

Example Slack bot for interfacing with your Juniper Mist environment

The repository hopes to act as a guide for building bots with Slack Bolt SDK. In our example, we will be building a Python-based Slack bot that will serve as an interface to Juniper Mist.

This project is structured to be more of an educational guide rather than a production-ready piece of software.

Handling the interaction with Mist's REST API, the Slack bot will return the result in an easy-to-read format.
